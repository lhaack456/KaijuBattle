This is a simple text and turn based fighting game based on the Godzilla Franchise (that will hopefully become an actual fighting game with combos and what not)
that I will work on when I'm in the mood to. 
I hope to, eventually, have:
*A fully fleshed out and balanced roster, each character having a unique gimmick
*Actual screen with moving sprites and stuff (Don't expect this for a LONG time)
*Combos for days! (Once the screen stuff is there)
For now though, it is simply a text-based game due to me being a beginner programmer, and this initially being used for a final project.
To run this program, you MUST be in a virtual environment using python3 -m venv env.
